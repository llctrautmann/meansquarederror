The Issue with Simple BTC narratives is that they are mostly not true, too simple or are not really helpful in advancing Bitcoin as a technology. For example, most people that have had any contact with Bitcoin, will have heard phrases lik:

- HODL
- WAGMI (we all gonna make it)
- Diamond Hands
- Paper Hands
- Money printer go BRRR.

The issue with these catch phrases: People stop thinking about Bitcoin and the future of the network, but instead they turn into parrots, mindlessly spouting out a learned but not understood narrative. 

I think this is pretty bad for Bitcoin in the
long run, especially when Bitcoiners proclaim themselves to be "doing their on research". If we do our own research - which I think we should do, let's do it properly. Just repeating shit on the internet is not research.

I want to show these issues with narrative with two terms that are fundamental to the world of Bitoin: Inflation and Deflation.

## Deflation vs. Price Deflation

Bitcoin and Crypto more generally proclaim themselves to be a deflationary currency. This is all good and well and many bitcoiners readily online hold the poistion that deflation is all we need and then prosperity will be right around the corner.

There is however a problem here that gets lost in the catch phrase:
$$
\text{BTC = Deflationary money}
$$

The nuance that gets lost in the reduction is the difference between monetary deflation and price deflation. Real monetary deflation is the lack of units of currency in a system to facilitate commerce. Nobody in Bitcoin should want that. This is in all likelihood a universally bad result, that would lead to mass unemployment, poverty and the rise of political ideas like fascism.

## Money Printing, supply shock and QE

One big narrative in Bitcoin goes as follows: "Bitcoin is a protection again out of control money printing by the central banks around the world". A very popular meme to underline this argument, is the famous Jay Powell (FED Chair 2018-present) printing crisp green backs.

The problem with that meme/rallying cry is that it does not fundamentally match reality.

- QE is not money printing
  - portfolio effects not money printing
  - interest rates not money printing
  - Sentiment not money printing

draft will be updated in the near future

<!-- - there is an argument to be made for Fiscal spending but that is not what people think about when they say money printer go brrrr..

- Remindes me of *insert name*, why said in 2016, trump voters shouting "build that wall" are actually calling for a "saner and more sensible immigration policy".

## What is my issue with narratives and the memes?

- the dollar/eurodollar is broken
- we need a new system
- we need people to think about this systems so that they can reasonablely participate
- memes do not help here, but mislead people
- this is a monumental task that requires effort, focus, and then some
- focusing on the wrong narratives does not help anyone in Bitcoin
- increases the cult-ish nature of bitcoin, as people are not able to present coherent arguments
  - beyond, the fed is evil, money printer go brrr -->
