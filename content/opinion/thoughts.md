1. More use of nuclear energy to bridge the next 100 years and allow for fully renewable energy technology for production, storage and distribution to be developed. 

2. A comprehensive plan for the future of europe in terms of political integration, that does not hesitate to expel member states that are clearly autocratic/dictatorial

3. Concrete ideas for climate change prevention that actually force citizens in Germany to change their behaviour and pop the illusion, that a solution for climate change can be found without any real change in the behaviour of the people.

4. A clear position from politicians what they want to do if - due to climate change or other external factors - the number of refugees rises into the millions. A position I will not accept is the killing or otherwise violent suppression of migration movements. 

5. More resources should be diverted into science to find better solutions for exisiting problems. 

6. Higher taxes for destructive industries, and useless industries that harm the population.
