## Projects
MAIN PROJECTS

1. __Phase Reconstruction of Audio Signals using Variational Autoencoder and Generative Adverserial Networks (_MSc. Dissertation Project_)__
- Generation of matching phase spectrograms for generated magnitude spectrograms using Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs) to allow the construction of audible sound within the field of ecoacoustics

2. __[Taxi Demand Prediction for time-series data (Central Park Area)](https://github.com/llctrautmann/TaxiDemandML)__
- Full data science pipeline project Feature engineering data pre-processing model creation and training with naive model, XGBoost, Catboost Model operationalization / MLOps and monitoring

3. __Comparison study of Drybean Classification performance with various ML techiques__
- Development of a data analysis pipeline for turkish drybeans to demonstrate the performance differences between algorithms for classification task Data processing and exploratory data analyses Deployment of MLP and Boosting algorithms for performance comparison Analysis of both deployed methods and comparison with naive classifier

4. __Comparision Study between different population-based optimisation algorithms to stabilize dynamic systems__

5. __Modelling how population-based optimization algorithms (i.e. Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithms) find a stable configuration of weights for a differential equation system__
