> **DEF:**
>The Jacobian is just the derivative for vector functions with multiple inputs and outputs.
>$$J_f=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=\left[\begin{array}{c}\nabla f_1^{\top} \\\ \vdots \\\ \nabla f_{n_f}^{\top}\end{array}\right]=\underbrace{\left[\begin{array}{ccc}\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_{n_x}} \\\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\ \frac{\partial f_{n_f}}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_{n_f}}{\partial x_{n_x}}\end{array}\right]}_{\left(n_f \times n_x\right)}$$
> - $n_f$ is the number of outputs of the function
> - $n_{x}$ is the number of inputs into the function

The Jacobian matrix, denoted as $J_f$, plays a crucial role in various fields such as engineering, physics, and mathematics, especially in the analysis of vector-valued functions. It encapsulates all the first-order partial derivatives of a vector function in a matrix form. This matrix is instrumental in understanding how changes in the input variables influence the output of the function.

In essence, the Jacobian provides a linear approximation to the function near a specific point, making it invaluable for tasks like optimization, where it helps in finding where a function reaches its maxima or minima. It's also pivotal in solving systems of nonlinear equations, as it appears in methods like Newton's method for finding roots of equations.

Moreover, the determinant of the Jacobian matrix, known as the Jacobian determinant, has its own significance. It gives important information about the volume distortion under the function, which is essential in fields like fluid dynamics and image processing.

Understanding the Jacobian and its properties can significantly enhance one's ability to deal with complex systems and provide insights into the behavior of multidimensional functions.
