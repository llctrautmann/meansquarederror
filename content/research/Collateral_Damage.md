Reading up on the demise of Lehman brothers is a facinating story. Granted most people are not interested in the details of the collapse, and usually attribute everything to bad loans due to the housing market bust in the US. But the more nerdy among us start to read the documents produced in the wake of the bankruptsy to understand what the main issue really was. Why did Lehman Brother's the titan of wall street really fail? And the number one word that describes the entire situation is **collateral**.

## Collateral and Repo in Financial Markets
### Collateral: A stylised Example
If a good friend of yours comes to you to borrow money you are probably willing to lend them the money without requiring extra security. Afterall, you know the person well, so you can be sure they will not run away with the money. But what if you are lending out money to a stranger?
Now things get trickier. You don't know that person so you probably want some security against the money that you are extending. Collateral is that security.

Collateral comes in different flavours depending on the risk associated with it. T-bills? Pristine collateral; Stocks? Terrible collateral.

Depending on the quality of the collateral, the haircut on the value of the collateral will be greater. This means for the same amount of borrowed money, the borrower needs to secure that deal with less amounts of t-bills, and more amounts of stocks. For example, the haircut on T-bills as collateral could be 3% and 8% on stocks.

For collateral there really exists only one rule from the lender side: How well can I sell the collateral if I should receive it in the event that the borrower is not able to return the money.

## Maturity Transformation

So how does Lehman Brother's fit into the picture? Large firms like Lehman Brother's make their money primarily through maturity transformation. In it's simplest description, Lehman borrowed short-term money and lend out in longer-term projects. The money it ears comes from the differences in short-term borrowing rates and the interest it demands for financing projects in the long-run. This leads to an obvious problem: **liquidity risk**.

Liquidity risk exists because Lehman needs to always have enough liquidity available to pay for its short-term liabilities. Over an infinite time span, lending out money at a higher rate than it costs to borrow, is an un-bankruptable buisiness model. But if you, as a firm, borrowed money short-term and all you liquidity is locked up in long-term projects or trades, you are still bankrupt. This is called a liquidity crunch and it is a nightmare for a bank.
