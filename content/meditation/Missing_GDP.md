One of the most striking calculations I have been doing in a while was graphically visualise the difference in GDP in the US (an the rest of the world) since the GFC.

Plotting the GDP shows a significant deviation from trend. In the image above what you can see is that the US had an L-shaped recovery since 2008, with the actual produced GDP far underperforming given the previous trendline set since the beginning of the Eurodollar system.

This is undoubtably a major issue. And it is an even worse picture, when looking at it from an international standpoint. 

Look at the graph that the German GDP produces.

I do not wonder anymore why crazy politicians pop up in Germany any more.
